"""Time

SDL realtime clock and date/time routines.

There are two data types that are used in this category: SDL_Time, which
represents the nanoseconds since a specific moment (an "epoch"), and
SDL_DateTime, which breaks time down into human-understandable components:
years, months, days, hours, etc.

Much of the functionality is involved in converting those two types to
other useful forms.
