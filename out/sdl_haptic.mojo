"""Haptic

The SDL haptic subsystem manages haptic (force feedback) devices.

The basic usage is as follows:

- Initialize the subsystem (SDL_INIT_HAPTIC).
- Open a haptic device.
- SDL_OpenHaptic() to open from index.
- SDL_OpenHapticFromJoystick() to open from an existing joystick.
- Create an effect (SDL_HapticEffect).
- Upload the effect with SDL_CreateHapticEffect().
- Run the effect with SDL_RunHapticEffect().
- (optional) Free the effect with SDL_DestroyHapticEffect().
- Close the haptic device with SDL_CloseHaptic().

Simple rumble example:

```c
   SDL_Haptic *haptic = NULL;

   // Open the device
   SDL_HapticID *haptics = SDL_GetHaptics(NULL);
   if (haptics) {
       haptic = SDL_OpenHaptic(haptics[0]);
       SDL_free(haptics);
   }
   if (haptic == NULL)
      return;

   // Initialize simple rumble
   if (!SDL_InitHapticRumble(haptic))
      return;

   // Play effect at 50% strength for 2 seconds
   if (!SDL_PlayHapticRumble(haptic, 0.5, 2000))
      return;
   SDL_Delay(2000);

   // Clean up
   SDL_CloseHaptic(haptic);
```

Complete example:

```c
bool test_haptic(SDL_Joystick *joystick)
{
   SDL_Haptic *haptic;
   SDL_HapticEffect effect;
   int effect_id;

   // Open the device
   haptic = SDL_OpenHapticFromJoystick(joystick);
   if (haptic == NULL) return false; // Most likely joystick isn't haptic

   // See if it can do sine waves
   if ((SDL_GetHapticFeatures(haptic) & SDL_HAPTIC_SINE)==0) {
      SDL_CloseHaptic(haptic); // No sine effect
      return false;
   }

   // Create the effect
   SDL_memset(&effect, 0, sizeof(SDL_HapticEffect)); // 0 is safe default
   effect.type = SDL_HAPTIC_SINE;
   effect.periodic.direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR; // Polar coordinates
   effect.periodic.direction.dir[0] = 18000; // Force comes from south
   effect.periodic.period = 1000; // 1000 ms
   effect.periodic.magnitude = 20000; // 20000/32767 strength
   effect.periodic.length = 5000; // 5 seconds long
   effect.periodic.attack_length = 1000; // Takes 1 second to get max strength
   effect.periodic.fade_length = 1000; // Takes 1 second to fade away

   // Upload the effect
   effect_id = SDL_CreateHapticEffect(haptic, &effect);

   // Test the effect
   SDL_RunHapticEffect(haptic, effect_id, 1);
   SDL_Delay(5000); // Wait for the effect to finish

   // We destroy the effect, although closing the device also does this
   SDL_DestroyHapticEffect(haptic, effect_id);

   // Close the device
   SDL_CloseHaptic(haptic);

   return true; // Success
}
```

Note that the SDL haptic subsystem is not thread-safe.

    This is the direction where the force comes from, instead of the direction

    - SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN : Specified by cartesian coordinates.
    - SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL : Specified by spherical coordinates.

    Cardinal directions of the haptic device are relative to the positioning of
    the device. North is considered to be away from the user.

    The following diagram represents the cardinal directions:

    ```

                    ---ooO-(_)-Ooo---
    ```

    If type is SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR, direction is encoded by hundredths of a degree
    starting north and turning clockwise. SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR only uses the first
    `dir` parameter. The cardinal directions would be:

    - North: 0 (0 degrees)
    - East: 9000 (90 degrees)
    - South: 18000 (180 degrees)
    - West: 27000 (270 degrees)

    If type is SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN, direction is encoded by three positions (X
    axis, Y axis and Z axis (with 3 axes)). SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN uses the first
    three `dir` parameters. The cardinal directions would be:

    - North: 0,-1, 0
    - East: 1, 0, 0
    - South: 0, 1, 0
    - West: -1, 0, 0

    The Z axis represents the height of the effect if supported, otherwise it's
    unused. In cartesian encoding (1, 2) would be the same as (2, 4), you can
    use any multiple you want, only the direction matters.

    If type is SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL, direction is encoded by two rotations. The
    first two `dir` parameters are used. The `dir` parameters are as follows
    (all values are in hundredths of degrees):

    - Degrees from (1, 0) rotated towards (0, 1).
    - Degrees towards (0, 0, 1) (device needs at least 3 axes).

    Example of force coming from the south with all encodings (force coming
    from the south means the user will have to pull the stick to counteract):

    ```c
     SDL_HapticDirection direction;

     // Cartesian directions
     direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN; // Using cartesian direction encoding.
     direction.dir[0] = 0; // X position
     direction.dir[1] = 1; // Y position
     // Assuming the device has 2 axes, we don't need to specify third parameter.

     // Polar directions
     direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR; // We'll be using polar direction encoding.
     direction.dir[0] = 18000; // Polar only uses first parameter

     // Spherical coordinates
     direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL; // Spherical encoding
     direction.dir[0] = 9000; // Since we only have two axes we don't need more parameters.
