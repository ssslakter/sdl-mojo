fn compose_custom_blend_mode(src_color_factor: BlendFactor, dst_color_factor: BlendFactor, color_operation: BlendOperation, src_alpha_factor: BlendFactor, dst_alpha_factor: BlendFactor, alpha_operation: BlendOperation) -> BlendMode:
    """Compose a custom blend mode for renderers.

    The functions SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode and SDL_SetTextureBlendMode accept
    the SDL_BlendMode returned by this function if the renderer supports it.

    A blend mode controls how the pixels from a drawing operation (source) get
    combined with the pixels from the render target (destination). First, the
    components of the source and destination pixels get multiplied with their
    blend factors. Then, the blend operation takes the two products and
    calculates the result that will get stored in the render target.

    Expressed in pseudocode, it would look like this:

    ```c
    dstRGB = colorOperation(srcRGB * srcColorFactor, dstRGB * dstColorFactor);
    dstA = alphaOperation(srcA * srcAlphaFactor, dstA * dstAlphaFactor);
    ```

    Where the functions `colorOperation(src, dst)` and `alphaOperation(src,
    dst)` can return one of the following:

    - `src + dst`
    - `src - dst`
    - `dst - src`
    - `min(src, dst)`
    - `max(src, dst)`

    The red, green, and blue components are always multiplied with the first,
    second, and third components of the SDL_BlendFactor, respectively. The
    fourth component is not used.

    The alpha component is always multiplied with the fourth component of the
    SDL_BlendFactor. The other components are not used in the alpha
    calculation.

    Support for these blend modes varies for each renderer. To check if a
    specific SDL_BlendMode is supported, create a renderer and pass it to
    either SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode or SDL_SetTextureBlendMode. They will
    return with an error if the blend mode is not supported.

    This list describes the support of custom blend modes for each renderer.
    All renderers support the four blend modes listed in the SDL_BlendMode
    enumeration.

    - **direct3d**: Supports all operations with all factors. However, some
      factors produce unexpected results with `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MINIMUM` and
      `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MAXIMUM`.
    - **direct3d11**: Same as Direct3D 9.
    - **opengl**: Supports the `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD` operation with all
      factors. OpenGL versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 do not work correctly here.
    - **opengles2**: Supports the `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD`,
      `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_SUBTRACT`, `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_REV_SUBTRACT`
      operations with all factors.
    - **psp**: No custom blend mode support.
    - **software**: No custom blend mode support.

    Some renderers do not provide an alpha component for the default render
    target. The `SDL_BLENDFACTOR_DST_ALPHA` and
    `SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA` factors do not have an effect in this
    case.

    Args:
        src_color_factor: The SDL_BlendFactor applied to the red, green, and
                          blue components of the source pixels.
        dst_color_factor: The SDL_BlendFactor applied to the red, green, and
                          blue components of the destination pixels.
        color_operation: The SDL_BlendOperation used to combine the red,
                         green, and blue components of the source and
                         destination pixels.
        src_alpha_factor: The SDL_BlendFactor applied to the alpha component of
                          the source pixels.
        dst_alpha_factor: The SDL_BlendFactor applied to the alpha component of
                          the destination pixels.
        alpha_operation: The SDL_BlendOperation used to combine the alpha
                         component of the source and destination pixels.

    Returns:
        An SDL_BlendMode that represents the chosen factors and
        operations.

    Safety:
        It is safe to call this function from any thread.
