"""Camera

Video capture for the SDL library.

This API lets apps read input from video sources, like webcams. Camera
devices can be enumerated, queried, and opened. Once opened, it will
provide SDL_Surface objects as new frames of video come in. These surfaces
can be uploaded to an SDL_Texture or processed as pixels in memory.

Several platforms will alert the user if an app tries to access a camera,
and some will present a UI asking the user if your application should be
allowed to obtain images at all, which they can deny. A successfully opened
camera will not provide images until permission is granted. Applications,
after opening a camera device, can see if they were granted access by
either polling with the SDL_GetCameraPermissionState() function, or waiting
for an SDL_EVENT_CAMERA_DEVICE_APPROVED or SDL_EVENT_CAMERA_DEVICE_DENIED
event. Platforms that don't have any user approval process will report
approval immediately.

Note that SDL cameras only provide video as individual frames; they will
not provide full-motion video encoded in a movie file format, although an
app is free to encode the acquired frames into any format it likes. It also
does not provide audio from the camera hardware through this API; not only
do many webcams not have microphones at all, many people--from streamers to
people on Zoom calls--will want to use a separate microphone regardless of
the camera. In any case, recorded audio will be available through SDL's
audio API no matter what hardware provides the microphone.

## Camera gotchas

Consumer-level camera hardware tends to take a little while to warm up,
once the device has been opened. Generally most camera apps have some sort
of UI to take a picture (a button to snap a pic while a preview is showing,
some sort of multi-second countdown for the user to pose, like a photo
booth), which puts control in the users' hands, or they are intended to
stay on for long times (Pokemon Go, etc).

It's not uncommon that a newly-opened camera will provide a couple of
completely black frames, maybe followed by some under-exposed images. If
taking a single frame automatically, or recording video from a camera's
input without the user initiating it from a preview, it could be wise to
drop the first several frames (if not the first several _seconds_ worth of
frames!) before using images from a camera.
