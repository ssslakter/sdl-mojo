"""Surface

SDL surfaces are buffers of pixels in system RAM. These are useful for
passing around and manipulating images that are not stored in GPU memory.

SDL_Surface makes serious efforts to manage images in various formats, and
provides a reasonable toolbox for transforming the data, including copying
between surfaces, filling rectangles in the image data, etc.

There is also a simple .bmp loader, SDL_LoadBMP(). SDL itself does not
provide loaders for various other file formats, but there are several
excellent external libraries that do, including its own satellite library,
SDL_image:

    Pixels are arranged in memory in rows, with the top row first. Each row

    Within each row, pixels are arranged from left to right until the width is

    with most formats representing each pixel as one or more whole bytes (in
    some indexed formats, instead multiple pixels are packed into each byte),

    remaining bytes to reach the pitch are used as padding to reach a desired
    alignment, and have undefined contents.

    When a surface holds YUV format data, the planes are assumed to be
    contiguous without padding between them, e.g. a 32x32 surface in NV12
    format with a pitch of 32 would consist of 32x32 bytes of Y plane followed
    by 32x16 bytes of UV plane.

    When a surface holds MJPG format data, pixels points at the compressed JPEG

    This function maps the RGBA color value to the specified pixel format and
    returns the pixel value best approximating the given RGBA color value for
    the given pixel format.

    If the surface pixel format has no alpha component the alpha value will be
    ignored (as it will be in formats with a palette).

    If the surface has a palette, the index of the closest matching color in
    the palette will be returned.

    If the pixel format bpp (color depth) is less than 32-bpp then the unused
    upper bits of the return value can safely be ignored (e.g., with a 16-bpp
    format the return value can be assigned to a Uint16, and similarly a Uint8
    for an 8-bpp format).

    Args:
        surface: The surface to use for the pixel format and palette.
        r: The red component of the pixel in the range 0-255.
        g: The green component of the pixel in the range 0-255.
        b: The blue component of the pixel in the range 0-255.

    Returns:
        A pixel value.
