"""Sensor

SDL sensor management.

These APIs grant access to gyros and accelerometers on various platforms.

In order to use these functions, SDL_Init() must have been called with the
SDL_INIT_SENSOR flag. This causes SDL to scan the system for sensors, and
load appropriate drivers.

    Accelerometer sensor notes:

    The accelerometer returns the current acceleration in SI meters per second
    squared. This measurement includes the force of gravity, so a device at
    rest will have an value of SDL_STANDARD_GRAVITY away from the center of the
    earth, which is a positive Y value.

    - `values[0]`: Acceleration on the x axis
    - `values[1]`: Acceleration on the y axis
    - `values[2]`: Acceleration on the z axis

    For phones and tablets held in natural orientation and game controllers
    held in front of you, the axes are defined as follows:

    - -X ... +X : left ... right
    - -Y ... +Y : bottom ... top
    - -Z ... +Z : farther ... closer

    The accelerometer axis data is not changed when the device is rotated.

    Gyroscope sensor notes:

    The gyroscope returns the current rate of rotation in radians per second.
    The rotation is positive in the counter-clockwise direction. That is, an
    observer looking from a positive location on one of the axes would see
    positive rotation on that axis when it appeared to be rotating
    counter-clockwise.

    - `values[0]`: Angular speed around the x axis (pitch)
    - `values[1]`: Angular speed around the y axis (yaw)
    - `values[2]`: Angular speed around the z axis (roll)

    For phones and tablets held in natural orientation and game controllers
    held in front of you, the axes are defined as follows:

    - -X ... +X : left ... right
    - -Y ... +Y : bottom ... top
    - -Z ... +Z : farther ... closer
