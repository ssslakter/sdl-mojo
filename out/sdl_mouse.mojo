"""Mouse

Any GUI application has to deal with the mouse, and SDL provides functions
to manage mouse input and the displayed cursor.

Most interactions with the mouse will come through the event subsystem.
Moving a mouse generates an SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_MOTION event, pushing a button
generates SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_BUTTON_DOWN, etc, but one can also query the
current state of the mouse at any time with SDL_GetMouseState().

For certain games, it's useful to disassociate the mouse cursor from mouse
input. An FPS, for example, would not want the player's motion to stop as
the mouse hits the edge of the window. For these scenarios, use
SDL_SetWindowRelativeMouseMode(), which hides the cursor, grabs mouse input
to the window, and reads mouse input no matter how far it moves.

Games that want the system to track the mouse but want to draw their own
cursor can use SDL_HideCursor() and SDL_ShowCursor(). It might be more
efficient to let the system manage the cursor, if possible, using
SDL_SetCursor() with a custom image made through SDL_CreateColorCursor(),
or perhaps just a specific system cursor from SDL_CreateSystemCursor().

SDL can, on many platforms, differentiate between multiple connected mice,
allowing for interesting input scenarios and multiplayer games. They can be
enumerated with SDL_GetMice(), and SDL will send SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_ADDED and
SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_REMOVED events as they are connected and unplugged.

Since many apps only care about basic mouse input, SDL offers a virtual
mouse device for touch and pen input, which often can make a desktop
application work on a touchscreen phone without any code changes. Apps that
care about touch/pen separately from mouse input should filter out events
with a `which` field of SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID/SDL_PEN_MOUSEID.

    Capturing enables your app to obtain mouse events globally, instead of just

    unlike relative mode, no change is made to the cursor and it is not

    This function may also deny mouse input to other windows--both those in
    your application and others on the system--so you should use this function

    mouse while the user is dragging something, until the user releases a mouse
    button. It is not recommended that you capture the mouse for long periods
    of time, such as the entire time your app is running. For that, you should
    probably use SDL_SetWindowRelativeMouseMode() or SDL_SetWindowMouseGrab(),

    While captured, mouse events still report coordinates relative to the
    current (foreground) window, but those coordinates may be outside the
    bounds of the window (including negative values). Capturing is only allowed
    for the foreground window. If the window loses focus while capturing, the
    capture will be disabled automatically.

    While capturing is enabled, the current window will have the
    `SDL_WINDOW_MOUSE_CAPTURE` flag set.

    Please note that SDL will attempt to "auto capture" the mouse while the
    user is pressing a button; this is to try and make mouse behavior more
    consistent between platforms, and deal with the common case of a user
    dragging the mouse outside of the window. This means that if you are

    surface will be interpreted as the content to be used for 100% display
    scale, and the alternate representations will be used for high DPI
    situations. For example, if the original surface is 32x32, then on a 2x
    macOS display or 200% display scale on Windows, a 64x64 version of the
    image will be used, if available. If a matching version of the image isn't
    available, the closest larger size image will be downscaled to the
    appropriate size and be used instead, if available. Otherwise, the closest
    smaller image will be upscaled and be used instead.

    Args:
        surface: An SDL_Surface structure representing the cursor image.
        hot_x: The x position of the cursor hot spot.
        hot_y: The y position of the cursor hot spot.

    Returns:
        The new cursor on success or NULL on failure; call SDL_GetError()
        for more information.

    Safety:
        This function should only be called on the main thread.
