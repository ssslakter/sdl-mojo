"""Surface

SDL surfaces are buffers of pixels in system RAM. These are useful for
passing around and manipulating images that are not stored in GPU memory.

SDL_Surface makes serious efforts to manage images in various formats, and
provides a reasonable toolbox for transforming the data, including copying
between surfaces, filling rectangles in the image data, etc.

There is also a simple .bmp loader, SDL_LoadBMP(). SDL itself does not
provide loaders for various other file formats, but there are several
excellent external libraries that do, including its own satellite library,
SDL_image:

    Pixels are arranged in memory in rows, with the top row first. Each row

    Within each row, pixels are arranged from left to right until the width is

    some indexed formats, instead multiple pixels are packed into each byte),

    remaining bytes to reach the pitch are used as padding to reach a desired

    When a surface holds YUV format data, the planes are assumed to be
    contiguous without padding between them, e.g. a 32x32 surface in NV12
    format with a pitch of 32 would consist of 32x32 bytes of Y plane followed
    by 32x16 bytes of UV plane.

    When a surface holds MJPG format data, pixels points at the compressed JPEG
