"""Video

SDL's video subsystem is largely interested in abstracting window
management from the underlying operating system. You can create windows,
manage them in various ways, set them fullscreen, and get events when
interesting things happen with them, such as the mouse or keyboard
interacting with a window.

The video subsystem is also interested in abstracting away some
platform-specific differences in OpenGL: context creation, swapping
buffers, etc. This may be crucial to your app, but also you are not
required to use OpenGL at all. In fact, SDL can provide rendering to those
windows as well, either with an easy-to-use
[2D API](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryRender)
or with a more-powerful
[GPU API](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryGPU)
. Of course, it can simply get out of your way and give you the window
handles you need to use Vulkan, Direct3D, Metal, or whatever else you like
directly, too.

The video subsystem covers a lot of functionality, out of necessity, so it
is worth perusing the list of functions just to see what's available, but
most apps can get by with simply creating a window and listening for
events, so start with SDL_CreateWindow() and SDL_PollEvent().

    - `SDL_WINDOW_EXTERNAL`: window not created by SDL
    - `SDL_WINDOW_MODAL`: window is modal
    - `SDL_WINDOW_HIGH_PIXEL_DENSITY`: window uses high pixel density back
      buffer if possible
    - `SDL_WINDOW_MOUSE_CAPTURE`: window has mouse captured (unrelated to
      MOUSE_GRABBED)
    - `SDL_WINDOW_ALWAYS_ON_TOP`: window should always be above others
    - `SDL_WINDOW_UTILITY`: window should be treated as a utility window, not
      showing in the task bar and window list
    - `SDL_WINDOW_TOOLTIP`: window should be treated as a tooltip and does not
      get mouse or keyboard focus, requires a parent window
    - `SDL_WINDOW_POPUP_MENU`: window should be treated as a popup menu,
      requires a parent window
    - `SDL_WINDOW_KEYBOARD_GRABBED`: window has grabbed keyboard input

    - `SDL_WINDOW_METAL`: window usable with a Metal instance
    - `SDL_WINDOW_TRANSPARENT`: window with transparent buffer

    The SDL_Window is implicitly shown if SDL_WINDOW_HIDDEN is not set.

    On Apple's macOS, you **must** set the NSHighResolutionCapable Info.plist
    property to YES, otherwise you will not receive a High-DPI OpenGL canvas.

    The window pixel size may differ from its window coordinate size if the
    window is on a high pixel density display. Use SDL_GetWindowSize() to query
    the client area's size in window coordinates, and
    SDL_GetWindowSizeInPixels() or SDL_GetRenderOutputSize() to query the
    drawable size in pixels. Note that the drawable size can vary after the
    window is created and should be queried again if you get an
    SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_PIXEL_SIZE_CHANGED event.

    If the window is created with any of the SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL or
    SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN flags, then the corresponding LoadLibrary function
    (SDL_GL_LoadLibrary or SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary) is called and the
    corresponding UnloadLibrary function is called by SDL_DestroyWindow().

    If SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN is specified and there isn't a working Vulkan driver,
    SDL_CreateWindow() will fail, because SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary() will fail.

    If SDL_WINDOW_METAL is specified on an OS that does not support Metal,
    SDL_CreateWindow() will fail.

    If you intend to use this window with an SDL_Renderer, you should use
    SDL_CreateWindowAndRenderer() instead of this function, to avoid window
    flicker.

    On non-Apple devices, SDL requires you to either not link to the Vulkan
    loader or link to a dynamic library version. This limitation may be removed
    in a future version of SDL.

      the application wants to use the Wayland surface for a custom role and
      does not want it attached to an XDG toplevel window. See
      [README/wayland](README/wayland) for more information on using custom
      surfaces.
    - `SDL_PROP_WINDOW_CREATE_WAYLAND_CREATE_EGL_WINDOW_BOOLEAN` - true if the

    The window is implicitly shown if the "hidden" property is not set.

    Windows with the "tooltip" and "menu" properties are popup windows and have
    the behaviors and guidelines outlined in SDL_CreatePopupWindow().

    If this window is being created to be used with an SDL_Renderer, you should
    not add a graphics API specific property
    (`SDL_PROP_WINDOW_CREATE_OPENGL_BOOLEAN`, etc), as SDL will handle that
    internally when it chooses a renderer. However, SDL might need to recreate
    your window at that point, which may cause the window to appear briefly,
    and then flicker as it is recreated. The correct approach to this is to
    create the window with the `SDL_PROP_WINDOW_CREATE_HIDDEN_BOOLEAN` property
    set to true, then create the renderer, then show the window with
    SDL_ShowWindow().

    Normally windows are dragged and resized by decorations provided by the

    example, one might have a borderless window that wants to be draggable from

    This function lets the app provide a callback that designates pieces of a

    Mouse input may not be delivered to your application if it is within a

    resizing the window and not deliver it to the application.

    Specifying NULL for a callback disables hit-testing. Hit-testing is
    disabled by default.

    Platforms that don't support this functionality will return false
    unconditionally, even if you're attempting to disable hit-testing.

    Your callback may fire at any time, and its firing does not indicate any

    the OS is deciding whether to drag your window, but it fires for lots of
    other reasons, too, some unrelated to anything you probably care about _and

    If the GL library is loaded at runtime with SDL_GL_LoadLibrary(), then all

    function pointers to OpenGL extensions.

    There are some quirks to looking up OpenGL functions that require some
    extra care from the application. If you code carefully, you can handle
    these quirks without any platform-specific code, though:

    - On Windows, function pointers are specific to the current GL context;
      this means you need to have created a GL context and made it current
      before calling SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(). If you recreate your context or
      create a second context, you should assume that any existing function
      pointers aren't valid to use with it. This is (currently) a
      Windows-specific limitation, and in practice lots of drivers don't suffer
      this limitation, but it is still the way the wgl API is documented to
      work and you should expect crashes if you don't respect it. Store a copy
      of the function pointers that comes and goes with context lifespan.
    - On X11, function pointers returned by this function are valid for any
      context, and can even be looked up before a context is created at all.
      This means that, for at least some common OpenGL implementations, if you
      look up a function that doesn't exist, you'll get a non-NULL result that
      is _NOT_ safe to call. You must always make sure the function is actually
      available for a given GL context before calling it, by checking for the
      existence of the appropriate extension with SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported(),
      or verifying that the version of OpenGL you're using offers the function
      as core functionality.
    - Some OpenGL drivers, on all platforms, *will* return NULL if a function
      isn't supported, but you can't count on this behavior. Check for
      extensions you use, and if you get a NULL anyway, act as if that
      extension wasn't available. This is probably a bug in the driver, but you
      can code defensively for this scenario anyhow.
    - Just because you're on Linux/Unix, don't assume you'll be using X11.
      Next-gen display servers are waiting to replace it, and may or may not
      make the same promises about function pointers.
    - OpenGL function pointers must be declared `APIENTRY` as in the example
      code. This will ensure the proper calling convention is followed on
      platforms where this matters (Win32) thereby avoiding stack corruption.

    Args:

    """Set the swap interval for the current OpenGL context.

    Some systems allow specifying -1 for the interval, to enable adaptive
    vsync. Adaptive vsync works the same as vsync, but if you've already missed
    the vertical retrace for a given frame, it swaps buffers immediately, which
    might be less jarring for the user during occasional framerate drops. If an
    application requests adaptive vsync and the system does not support it,
    this function will fail and return false. In such a case, you should
    probably retry the call with 1 for the interval.

    Adaptive vsync is implemented for some glX drivers with
    GLX_EXT_swap_control_tear, and for some Windows drivers with
    WGL_EXT_swap_control_tear.
