"""Render

Header file for SDL 2D rendering functions.

This API supports the following features:

- single pixel points
- single pixel lines
- filled rectangles
- texture images
- 2D polygons

The primitives may be drawn in opaque, blended, or additive modes.

The texture images may be drawn in opaque, blended, or additive modes. They
can have an additional color tint or alpha modulation applied to them, and
may also be stretched with linear interpolation.

This API is designed to accelerate simple 2D operations. You may want more
functionality such as polygons and particle effects and in that case you
should use SDL's OpenGL/Direct3D support, the SDL3 GPU API, or one of the
many good 3D engines.

These functions must be called from the main thread. See this bug for
details: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/986

    This function sets the width and height of the logical rendering output.

    This can be useful for games that expect a fixed size, but would like to
    scale the output to whatever is available, regardless of how a user resizes
    a window, or if the display is high DPI.

    Logical presentation can be used with both render target textures and the

    resolution of the render target; it is safe to toggle logical presentation
    during the rendering of a frame: perhaps most of the rendering is done to
    specific dimensions but to make fonts look sharp, the app turns off logical
    presentation while drawing text, for example.

    For the renderer's window, letterboxing is drawn into the framebuffer if
    logical presentation is enabled during SDL_RenderPresent; be sure to
    reenable it before presenting if you were toggling it, otherwise the
    letterbox areas might have artifacts from previous frames (or artifacts
    from external overlays, etc). Letterboxing is never drawn into texture
    render targets; be sure to call SDL_RenderClear() before drawing into the

    SDL's rendering functions operate on a backbuffer; that is, calling a

    entire scene and *present* the composed backbuffer to the screen as a

    assume that previous contents will exist between frames. You are strongly

    to call `SDL_RenderPresent` after drawing needed objects to a texture, and

    """Draw debug text to an SDL_Renderer.

    This function will render a string of text to an SDL_Renderer. Note that
    this is a convenience function for debugging, with severe limitations, and
    not intended to be used for production apps and games.

    Among these limitations:

    - It accepts UTF-8 strings, but will only renders ASCII characters.
    - It has a single, tiny size (8x8 pixels). One can use logical presentation
      or scaling to adjust it, but it will be blurry.
    - It uses a simple, hardcoded bitmap font. It does not allow different font
      selections and it does not support truetype, for proper scaling.
    - It does no word-wrapping and does not treat newline characters as a line
      break. If the text goes out of the window, it's gone.

    For serious text rendering, there are several good options, such as
    SDL_ttf, stb_truetype, or other external libraries.

    On first use, this will create an internal texture for rendering glyphs.
    This texture will live until the renderer is destroyed.

    The text is drawn in the color specified by SDL_SetRenderDrawColor().

    Args:
        renderer: The renderer which should draw a line of text.
        x: The x coordinate where the top-left corner of the text will draw.
        y: The y coordinate where the top-left corner of the text will draw.
