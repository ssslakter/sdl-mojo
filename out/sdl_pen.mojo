"""Pen

SDL pen event handling.

SDL provides an API for pressure-sensitive pen (stylus and/or eraser)
handling, e.g., for input and drawing tablets or suitably equipped mobile /
tablet devices.

To get started with pens, simply handle SDL_EVENT_PEN_* events. When a pen
starts providing input, SDL will assign it a unique SDL_PenID, which will
remain for the life of the process, as long as the pen stays connected.

Pens may provide more than simple touch input; they might have other axes,
such as pressure, tilt, rotation, etc.

    These show up in pen events when SDL sees input from them. They remain
    consistent as long as SDL can recognize a tool to be the same pen; but if a
    pen physically leaves the area and returns, it might get a new ID.
